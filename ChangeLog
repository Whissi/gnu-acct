	(desired_entry): when using the `--strict-match' flag, match all
 	items in all_list to the current entry.

	* hashtab.c (get_key_len): fix typo in error message.

	* accounting.texi (Preface): add Alexander Kourakos and Derek
 	Clegg to contributors.

  	Thanks to Derek Clegg.
	* pacct_rd.h: similar deal for pacct_rd_never_used.

	* last.c: added global variables to keep track of field widths
 	that the user desires for printing.  Added `-w' and `--wide' flags

	* configure.in: Add AC_C_CONST.  Also, avoid using an indented #
	in cpp macros or the #elif directive.  Avoid using ANSI string
	concatination in fputs, use fprintf instead.

	* dump-acct.c: Avoid ANSI string concatination.
	* dump-utmp.c: Likewise.

	* configure: regenerated.

1997-10-08  Noel Cragg  <noel@swish.red-bean.com>

	* Makefile.am (compare): new target.  Since what we're really
	doing is comparing the output of these utils to the system's utils
	(and not in anything resembling an automated fashion -- I'm not
	sure _that_ can be accomplished), don't use the "check" target.

	* Makefile.in: regenerated.

	* dev_hash.h: same.
	* file_rd.h: same.

	* accounting.texi: include the automake-generated version.texi
	file so we can automatically substitute VERSION and UPDATED
	variables.

	* texinfo.tex: removed -- automake supplies it.

Mon Sep 29 13:34:05 1997  Noel Cragg  <noel@swish.red-bean.com>

	* configure: regenerated again (lots of changes today, no?).
	* config.h.in: same.
	* Makefile.in: same.
	
	* configure.in: changed order around to make automake happy.
  	Changed the substitutions for pacct programs being built by
 	creating a variable for each program in question.  This allows us
 	to place the definitions for those in different install targets in
 	the generated Makefile.

	* acconfig.h: add a #define for PROTOTYPES.  This will mean source
 	changes, too, but those haven't been completed yet.

	* Makefile.am: choose the correct bin directories for each program
 	and fix the rules for man pages.  Comment out tests for the time
 	being, until my tests can be munged into the correct form for
 	automake.

	* Makefile.in: thought better of removing it, actually.  We
 	include "configure" even though it is regenerated, no?
		
	* accounting.texi: rms says that the manual shouldn't contain the
 	locations of the system files -- we want to be able to share
 	manuals between systems.  Removed all locations and added a note
 	about default filesystem locations of wtmp and acct files.  Also
 	made below change to common.c to make it easier for people to
 	track down their system files.
	* ac.1: same, plus renamed from ac.1.in since we no longer need to
 	substitute pathnames into this file.
	* accton.8: same, similar.
	* last.1: same, similar.
	* lastcomm.1: same, similar.
	* sa.8: same, similar.
	
	* common.c (print_acct_file_locations): new function.  Display the
 	locations of the default process accouting files.
	(print_wtmp_file_location): new function.  Same as above, but for
 	the wtmp file.
	* common.h: add prototypes for above.
	* ac.c: call the appropriate function above when giving help.
	* accton.c: same.
	* dump-acct.c: same.
	* dump-utmp.c: same.
	* last.c: same.
	* lastcomm.c: same.
	* sa.c: same.

	* Fixed copyright dates in all files to conform to
 	gnuorg/maintain.text.

	* configure.in: add a default in the AC_TRY_RUN macro for
 	cross-compiling so autoconf doesn't complain every time it is run.
	* configure: regenerated.

	* install-sh: renamed from install.sh.

	* mkinstalldirs: add to conform to automake.
	
	* version.h.in: do text substitution via autoconf to get our
 	version number to conform to automake.
	* version.h: removed -- now automatically generated.
	* ac.c: use new #define -- VERSION_STRING -- from version.h
	* accton.c: same.
	* last.c: same.
	* lastcomm.c: same.
	* sa.c: same.
	
	* Makefile.am: new file.  Converted the package to use automake.
  	What a gas!
	* Makefile.in: removed, since automake generates it.
	
	* AUTHORS: new file, added to meet GNU standards.
	* NEWS: same.

	* INSTALL: new version from FSF.

	* configure.in: convert old autoconf macro names to new.
	* configure: regenerated.
	* config.h.in: regenerated.

	* Makefile.in (prefix): fix typo -- missing `@' signs.  Thanks to
 	Walter Mueller <walt@pi4.informatik.uni-mannheim.de>.
	
	* file_rd.c (file_reader_get_entry): cast pointers to (char *)
 	before doing pointer arithmetic, also from Eric.
	
	* configure.in: add fixes to support HP-UX 9.05 with /bin/cc.
  	Thanks to Eric Backus <ericb@lsid.hp.com>.

	* alloca.c: new file, for those system that don't have alloca.
	* Makefile.in: add @ALLOCA@ to all object lists.
	
Tue Aug 19 10:20:55 1997  Noel Cragg  <noel@swish.red-bean.com>

 	elapsed) time.
	* sa.8.in: document it.

	* last.c: add `--print-seconds' option and change name for
 	`--year' to `--print-year' and add docs.
	* last.1.in: document it.

	* sa.c (print_user_list): increment the number of users _before_
 	allocating the entry array, or else we'll clobber memory.

Thu Nov 21 21:03:31 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@coyote.rain.org>

	* last.c (print_record): check for all printable ascii characters
 	rather than just alphanumerics.

Thu Sep  5 14:12:04 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle.rain.org>

	* last.c (print_record): print out '?' instead of control
 	characters for tty names.

Wed Aug 14 13:21:20 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@kiva.rain.org>

	* hashtab.c (hashtab_resize): code to increase the number of
 	buckets in a hash table.

 	O(1), if possible.

	* hashtab.c (hashtab_find): use MEMCMP instead of STRNCMP.
	(hashtab_create): same.

	* sa.c (parse_acct_entries): more typos!  Damnit!
	(print_stats_nicely): I hope this is finally the right formula.
	(parse_acct_entries): fix memory printout for PRINT_USERS section.

	* pacct_rd.c (comp_t_2_double): make this routine faster by doing
 	bit-shifts rather than floating-point math.

	* sa.c (main): remove NUMBER_SORTING_OPTIONS because we want to be
 	ableo to include various fields (some flags have sorting
 	side-effects) but sort by the last thing specified.
	(parse_acct_entries): fix four typos -- COMPT instead of COMP_T.
  	Ugh.

	* dump-acct.c: add flags `-R', `--raw', `-n', and `-num' for both
 	raw output and number of records to print.
	* dump-utmp.c: same.

	* Makefile.in: fix test scripts not to check for SYS_XXX programs.
  	Also, put "-" before execution of TIME command so a bad return
 	status won't screw us up (hal.gnu.ai.mit.edu does this).

	* configure.in: fix typo of AC_CHECK_PROGS --> AC_PATH_PROGS.

Thu Apr 18 11:07:02 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle>

	* install.sh: added to repository so we can support an INSTALL
 	target.
	* configure.in: look for an INSTALL program.

	* configure.in: don't use WHICH to find programs, since autoconf
 	now has AC_CHECK_PROGS.

	* al_share.cpp (parse_entries): forgot to remove variable
 	LAST_TIME -- last reported the wrong date at the end of
 	processing.

        * sa.c: use new hash routines.
	
	* hashtab.h (hashtab_elem): change key type from CHAR * to VOID *
 	to support non-strings.
	* hashtab.c (hashtab_find): same.

	* accounting.texi.in: fix docs -- all options for sa were actually
 	implemented some time ago.
	* sa.8.in: same.

	* al_share.cpp: new file -- since PARSE_ENTRIES is structurally
 	the same in both ac.c and last.c, let's only have one copy of it
 	with #ifdefs for the appropriate program.
	* ac.c: use al_share.cpp.
	* last.c: use al_share.cpp.

	* sa.c: remove all of that #ifdef hair.  Now it's half its
 	original size!  Gee, looking at it before mods, you'd think I was
 	4 years old when I wrote that!
	
	* dev_hash.c: use new generic hash table code.
	(clear_dev_table): removed -- unused.
	(setup_devices): declare static, since we do the setup here.
	* lastcomm.c: don't call SETUP_DEVICES.

	* hashtab.c (hashtab_init): accept a parameter that tells the code
 	whether or not the thing being hashed is a string or a number.  If
 	it's a number, it shouldn't be truncated like a string might be.
  	Changed callers.
	(get_key_len): modify to accept the numeric parameter also.

	* uid_hash.c: use new generic hash table code.
	(clear_uid_table): removed function, since it's no longer used.
	* lastcomm.c: don't call CLEAR_UID_TABLE.
	* sa.c: same.
	
	* sa.c (init_flags_and_data): use MEMSET to clear summary record
 	rather than setting each individual field to zero.

	* Makefile.in: general clean-up; remove deprecated targets and
 	reorganize.

	* pacct_rd.c (print_pacct_record): new function (similar to mods
 	made earlier to utmp_rd.c).  Change callers to use this function.
	(pacct_get_entry): delete argument which made the file reader
 	print the entry.  Use PRINT_PACCT_RECORD instead.
	* lastcomm.c: use PRINT_PACCT_RECORD.
	* sa.c: same.
	* dump-acct.c: same.

	* files.h.in: fix for multiple inclusion.

        * Makefile.in: put @DEFS@ in for CFLAGS, so MKTIME.C gets defs
 	from CONFIG.H.
	(realclean): fix realclean target to clean up newly
 	autoconf-generated files.

	* ac.c: fixed #includes for time headers (use autoconf symbols).
  	Also change names of XXX_FILE to XXX_FILE_LOC.
	* last.c: same.
	* lastcomm.c: same.
	* sa.c: same.

	* ac.1.in: new file which has autoconf-substitution-style variable
 	names.
	* accton.8.in: same.
	* last.1.in: same.
	* lastcomm.1.in: same.
	* sa.8.in: same.
	* accounting.texi.in: same.
	
	* ac.1: removed, since we now use autoconf to substitute
 	filenames automatically.
	* accton.8: same.
	* last.1: same.
	* lastcomm.1: same.
	* sa.8: same.
	* accounting.texi: same.

	* files.h.in: automatic substitution of variable names by
 	autoconf.
	
	* configure.in: add comments, include stuff that used to be in
 	FILES.H, substitute new files.

	* files.h: move #ifdefs that were here into CONFIGURE.IN, so we
 	can insert those values into man pages and other docs.  Removed
 	this file.
	
Wed Apr 17 20:51:40 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle>

	* utmp_rd.c (bad_utmp_record): new routine to check for obviously
 	bad records (like all zeroes).
	* ac.c (parse_entries): use it.
	* last.c (parse_entries): use it.

	* ac.c (parse_entries): check for empty records (that is, where
 	UT_LINE and UT_NAME are both empty).
	* last.c (parse_entries): same.

Wed Apr 17 23:43:18 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@occs.cs.oberlin.edu>

	* last.c (print_record): Don't print replacement TTY name if we're
	on a BSD system.

	* last.c (parse_entries): cast the argument of CTIME to the right
	type.
	* ac.c (parse_entries): same.

Wed Apr 17 10:40:07 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle>

	* utmp_rd.h (UTMAXTYPE): #define this to a reasonable default if
 	it wasn't done by the system.

	* utmp_rd.c (fix_ut_type_field): fix records that have an
 	out-of-range UT_TYPE field.

        * last.c: make sure all uses of print_which_recs are inside #ifdef
 	HAVE_UT_TYPE blocks.
	
        * hashtab.c: forgot to #include "config.h"...
	
        * dev_hash.c: add some #ifdefs for autoconfiscated headers
 	(string.h, stdlib.h, etc.).
	* file_rd.c: same.
	* hashtab.c: same.

	* utmp_rd.c: same.
	
	* last.c: remove #includes for INET_NTOA, since we get it from
 	utmp_rd.h.
	* utmp_rd.c: same.
	
	* utmp_rd.h: add #includes for INET_NTOA.

	* last.c (parse_entries): fix an #ifdef so we don't define a label
 	unless we're under linux.

	* Makefile.in (VPATH): add this to support different compilation
 	directories.

        * ac.c (parse_entries): added TIME_WARP_SUSPICIOUS for time warps
 	forward that are greater than the value of that variable.  Does
 	the same thing as the backwards time warps.  Added command-line
 	flag `--tw-suspicious' to deal with it and updated usage string.
  	Renamed `--timewarp-value' to `--tw-leniency' for consistency.
	* last.c (parse_entries): same.
	* ac.1: updated docs.
	* last.1: updated docs.
	* accounting.texi: updated docs.
	
	* ac.c (do_totals): removed the PRINT_FLAG argument, since all
 	callers were passing the same thing.  Changed callers.
	(main): add `-a' and `--all-days' flags -- user can choose whether
 	they want to see all of the days printed.  Useful for graphing
 	programs.
	* ac.1: updated docs.
	* accounting.texi: updated docs.

	* utmp_rd.c (fix_ut_type_field): new fix for machines that write
 	logouts of user processes with USER_PROCESS instead of
 	DEAD_PROCESS.
	* ac.c (parse_entries): same -- handles this case in case
 	DEAD_PROCESS is not available.
	
	* last.c (parse_entries): same.

	* ac.c (main): move init for utmp reader before parsing options
 	because we might choose to use an alternate wtmp file.
	* last.c (main): same.
	* lastcomm.c (main): same, but for pacct files.
	* sa.c (main): same, but for pacct files.

	* ac.c (give_usage): forgot to change string to reflect new `-f'
 	and `--file' flags.

	* hashtab.c (hashtab_create): use the TABLE_SIZE structure element
 	instead of the #defined HASH_SIZE.

	* ac.c (main): add `-y' and `--year' flags.
	(parse_entries): use DO_TOTALS instead of cutting & pasting the
 	code with minor changes.
	(do_totals): accept a few more args so that we can use it in the
 	above.

	* last.c (print_record): get rid of the EVENT_ENUM business and go
 	for a simpler solution: pass in values of strings that should
 	replace UT_NAME, UT_LINE, and the message at the end of the line.
  	This way, we don't have to switch on UT_TYPE and the enum all over
 	again.

	* dump-utmp.c (main): use PRINT_UTMP_RECORD.

        * ac.c: rename PRINT_FILE_INCONSISTENCIES to PRINT_FILE_PROBLEMS.
	* last.c: same.
	
	* Makefile.in: update dependencies.

	* lastcomm.1: update documentation for new flags.
	* last.1: same.
	* ac.1: same.
	* accounting.texi: same.

	* lastcomm.c (main): add `-f' and change `--other-file' to
 	`--file' to save typing.
	* ac.c (main): same.
	* last.c (main): same, but also remove `--supplants' flag, since
 	this is really covered under the `--complain' flag.  Add
 	`--more-records' and `-x' to give similar results as Miquel van
 	Smoorenburg's last program under Linux.
	
	* ac.c (parse_entries): changed flow again and re-incorporated
 	RECORD_TYPE #define thing.  Instead of trying to handle both types
 	of records with a bunch of kludges in the main switch statement,
 	we use FIX_UT_TYPE_FIELD.
	* last.c (parse_entries): same.

	* utmp_rd.c (fix_ut_type_field): new function -- makes bsd records
 	into sysv records.  For those machines that have a combination of
 	bsd and sysv records in their log files (Linux).
	
	* utmp_rd.h: re-insert #define RECORD_TYPE stuff so we can have a
 	single, unified switch statement for ac and last.

Tue Apr 16 01:57:28 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle>

	* utmp_rd.c (utmp_get_entry): change to take no parameters.
	(print_utmp_record): new function.  Changed callers to use this
 	function rather than pass a flag to UTMP_GET_ENTRY.

	* last.c (log_everyone_in): fix bug that printed placeholder
 	records as real supplants.

	* ac.c (parse_entries): change debugging print string for standard
 	column widths (easier to read).

	* name_list.c: removed -- hash tables are more efficient.  This
 	was mainly cut-and-paste, so there's not much work lost.
	* name_list.h: removed.

	* last.c: use hash tables.
	* lastcomm.c: use hash tables.

	* hashtab.c (hashtab_dump_keys): new file -- generic hash table
 	handling code to replace slow linked list stuff in all files.
	* hashtab.h: new headers for above.
	* ac.c: use hash tables.

	* name_list.c: new file -- common code for linked lists of
 	strings.  Changed callers.
	* name_list.h: header for above.
	
	* file_rd.c: new file -- common code from pacct_rd.c and
 	utmp_rd.c, to keep mistakes down.  Changed callers.
	* file_rd.h: protos & data for above.

Tue Apr  9 00:43:13 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle>

        * ac.c: a few casts needed for a clean compile under Ultrix.
	(main): fix `-z' flag and change `--dont-print-zeroes' to
 	`--print-zeros.'
	* accounting.texi: fix docs.
	* ac.1: same.

	* last.c: same.
	
        * ac.c (parse_entries): reorganize switch loop so sysv-isms are
 	checked first.  If no cases match, things fall through to
 	bsd-isms.
	* last.c (parse_entries): same.

	* configure.in: rename SYSTEM_V_STYLE_RECORDS to HAVE_UT_TYPE.
	* acconfig.h: same.
	* ac.c: same.

	* last.c: same.

        * ac.c: make all file problem strings contain the word "problem:"
 	for easy grepping.
	(parse_entries): remove big switch statement and use IFs instead
 	(since we have to check for both sysv and bsd syntaxes).
	
	* utmp_rd.h: removed definition of RECORD_TYPE, since some sysv
 	boxes use a combo of sysv and bsd syntaxes, so we have to check
 	for both.  Yecch!

	* configure.in: check for UT_ID and UT_PID fields in utmp.h.
	* acconfig.h: #undefs for above.
	* utmp_rd.c (utmp_get_entry): print out the above fields if
 	available.
	
	* ac.c (update_system_time): change order of the debugging print
 	statement and the addition so the right values are reported.
	(do_totals): put the call to localtime INSIDE the local scope of
 	the thing that needs to use it, otherwise it is wasted CPU.
	(log_in): check for empty UT_LINE field.
	(log_out): same.

	* utmp_rd.c (utmp_get_entry): remove "bad record" stuff -- we
 	don't want to filter out any records, really.

        * ac.h: removed this -- never used.  Gee, I wrote this a long time
 	ago before I knew very much.  Oh, well.
	* last.h: same.
	* lastcomm.h: same.
	* sa.h: same.
	
        * last.c: changed vars which keep track of times to TIME_T from
 	LONG.

	* last.c (log_in): same bogosity as ac.c (log_in), below.
	(log_everyone_in): same.

	* ac.c: changed variables which keep track of times to TIME_T from
 	LONG.  This way, we use the system's precision.
	(log_out): the stuff about daylight savings time was completely
 	wrong -- while stuff returned by localtime may jump around, time_t
 	is always stepwise continuous.  If there's a negative number, we
 	may have overflowed TIME_T.  Removed bogus stuff.
	(log_everyone_out): same.
	(update_user_time): add a check for negative TIME_T values and
 	holler if we see one.

	* ac.c (parse_entries): correct a bug when trying to print out
 	wtmp files which use dates in the future.

	* utmp_rd.c: it was possible to print out an error message without
 	a filename and crash the program -- add a variable which should
 	always be set with the filename from which records were read.
	* pacct_rd.c: same.

	* ac.1: Dirk sent more changes that fix small typos and formatting
 	junk in the docs.  Applied!
	* accton.8: same.
	* last.1: same.
	* lastcomm.1: same.
	* sa.8: same.
	* accounting.texi: same.

Mon Apr  8 16:52:49 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle>

	* accounting.texi: documentation changes for new flags and
 	credits.

	* version.h: increment to 6.1.

	* Makefile.in (accton): include getopt.o and getopt1.o.

	* ac.c (main): add short options "-h" and "-V" for "--help" and
 	"--version" respectively.  Make sure usage strings match list of
 	commands passed to getopt.
	* last.c (main): same.
	* lastcomm (main): same.
	* sa.c (main): same.

	* accton.c (main): use getopt so we can provide the "--version"
 	and "--help" flags.

	* last.c (print_record): print out the IP address if we have
 	UT_ADDR.
	(main): rename "--print-address" to "--ip-address" to get printing
 	of IP addresses instead of hosts.

	* utmp_rd.c (utmp_get_entry): don't print the IP address if it
 	isn't there.

	* last.c (display_date): print out a given date, paying attention
 	to the PRINT_YEAR flag.
	(main): add "--year" and "-y" flags, so the user can choose to
 	print out the year with dates.

	* ac.c (main): fix long options to use enums.
	* lastcomm.c (main): same.
	* sa.c (main): same.

	* mktime.c: new version from GNU C library.  HOORAY!  Paul Eggert
 	(the tz guru) has contributed his mktime routine to the C library!
  	Away with my broken routine!

	* ac.c (midnight_after_me): bug fixed -- the code was skipping a
 	few days and attributing DST hours to the day AFTER the DST change
 	occurred because I forgot to set tm_isdst to something negative
 	(mktime figures out DST stuff then).

	* pacct_rd.c (pacct_get_entry): change record print format (use
 	fixed field widths to make things easier to read).
	* utmp_rd.c (utmp_get_entry): same.

	* ac.c (midnight_after_me): use mktime instead of adding the "26
 	hours" business and handing off to MIDNIGHT_BEFORE_ME.  Yecch!
  	Also, take a long instead of a pointer to such.  Changed callers.
	(midnight_before_me): removed function -- not used.

Sun Apr  7 00:25:42 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle>

	* ac.c (parse_entries): fix RUN_LVL special case for those
 	machines that incorrectly report shutdowns and reboots as RUN_LVL
 	instead of BOOT_TIME.

	* dump-utmp.c (main): forgot to include case values for short
 	options.
	* dump-acct.c (main): same.

	* utmp_rd.c (utmp_get_entry): print ut_addr and ut_host if
 	available.

	* last.c: add skeletal code to take advantage of the ut_addr field
 	(if a system has it).  Need options yet.

	* configure.in (HAVE_UT_ADDR): check for the ut_addr field in
 	the system's utmp.h.
	* acconfig.h: add proto #undef.

Fri Apr  5 17:43:02 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle>

	* pacct_rd.c (comp_t_2_double): don't call POW!  Since our
 	exponent will always be an integer, we can do this ourself much
 	faster than the library routine.

	* dump-acct.c: add prototype for main to shut up gcc.
	* dump-utmp.c: same.

	* configure.in: have CFLAGS include -Wall and -Wmissing-prototypes
 	only if we're using gcc.
	* Makefile.in: same.

	* common.c (file_open): Actually, this stat business is a bad
 	idea.  Who cares if we open regular files or named pipes (or
 	/dev/null, for that matter?).  Modify the routine to recognize "-"
 	as an alias for stdin/stdout.

Fri Apr  5 20:17:09 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@occs.cs.oberlin.edu>

	* common.c: need to include sys/types.h for Ultrix.
	(file_open): don't check for a specific error status from stat.

	* Makefile.in (DA_LIBS): needs -lm for the comp_t stuff.

Fri Apr  5 11:08:22 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle>

	* pacct_rd.c (pacct_get_entry): accept PRINT_FLAG, which tells the
 	routine whether or not it should print out the entries as it reads
 	them (for dump-acct).
	* lastcomm.c: changed call to PACCT_GET_ENTRY.
	* sa.c: same.

	* utmp_rd.c (utmp_get_entry): accept PRINT_FLAG, which tells the
 	routine whether or not it should print out the entries as it reads
 	them (for dump-utmp).
	* ac.c: change call to UTMP_GET_ENTRY.
	* last.c: same.

	* acconfig.h: new symbol -- HAVE_LINUX_ACCT_H as a work-around
 	under Linux while we wait for the C library to get a sys/acct.h
	* configure.in: check for linux/acct.h.
	* pacct_rd.h: choose linux/acct.h or sys/acct.h.
	
	* dump-acct.c: new file for dumping acct/pacct files in a
 	human-readable format.  Remember "sumrd.c" from the old days?
	* dump-utmp.c: same for utmp files.
	* Makefile.in: rules for dump-* programs.
	* configure.in: add dump-acct to the list of pacct-related
 	programs to build (if available).

	* lastcomm.1 (type): update documentation to reflect new options.
	* accounting.texi (lastcomm): same.

	* lastcomm.c: renamed NAME_LIST to ALL_LIST and added three new
 	lists (with similar function) -- TTY_LIST, COMMAND_LIST, and
 	USER_LIST.  Each of these lists is used to match only a
 	tty/command/username.  Luc I. Suryo <root@patriots.nl.mugnet.org>
 	was having problems matching user `ed' because that is also the
 	name of a command.
	(cons_name_list): new function to cons values onto a list of
 	names.
	(dump_name_list): print out the contents of a name list.

	* lastcomm.c (parse_entries): check to see that there are no
 	unprintable characters in command names.
	(main): new flag `--print-controls' to control whether or not
 	control characters are printed.
	
	* ac.1: tell the user that the units are HOURS.
	* accounting.texi (ac): same.

	* last.c (parse_entries): change information string that prints
 	after end of execution to include seconds and year.

Thu Apr  4 12:15:47 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle>

	* common.c (file_open): renamed from OPEN_BINARY.  Now checks file
 	types before opening, to make sure we're not opening directories
 	or other weird things.
	* last.c: use FILE_OPEN.
	* ac.c: use FILE_OPEN.
	* lastcomm.c: use FILE_OPEN.
	* sa.c: use FILE_OPEN.

	* lastcomm.c: change inclusion order so we don't accidentally
 	redefine AHZ.  Ugh.

	* ac.c (do_statistics): change formatting slightly -- put a space
 	in between username and total (unlike BSD) to make us friendly
 	with awk and perl.

	* common.c (rename): new function as a replacement for those
 	machines that don't have it (Xenix -- Christoph again).
	* common.h: add proto.
	* configure.in: add code to check for rename in sys libs.
	* acconfig.h: add proto #undef.

	* last.c: change #if clauses around retsigtype stuff (also from
 	Christoph).

	* files.h: change for Xenix to use /usr/adm/pacct from Christoph
 	Badura <bad@flatlin.ka.sub.org>.
	* sa.c (print_stats_nicely): Christoph says that ac_mem IS NOT a
 	comp_t (for Xenix) -- but some machines have it defined that way,
 	like suns.

	* ac.c (do_statistics): change tabbing so that columns line up.

	* sa.c (print_command_list): quit if there are no entries to
 	report.

Sun Jan 28 17:02:52 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle.psych.oberlin.edu>

	* Makefile.in (info, dvi): overlooked these targets.  Thanks to
 	David S. Miller <davem@caip.rutgers.edu> for noticing!

Sat Jan 27 00:05:40 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle.psych.oberlin.edu>

	* README: updated to reflect newest info.

        * sa.c: I've just done the most horrible thing imaginable -- I've
 	put too many #ifdef statements in this program.  Turns out that
 	some OS's don't have the full STRUCT ACCT so we need to provide as
 	much as we can, but no more.  The solution: comment out the stuff
 	that's not applicable.  Ugh.
	
	* sa.c (hash_name): simpler (but similar) hash function.

	* common.c (desired_entry): removed function and moved to the
 	appropriate source files (ac.c, last.c) since it wasn't applicable
 	to all programs.

	* utmp_rd.h (HOST_LEN): new #define for those machines that have
 	the UT_HOST field in STRUCT UTMP.
	* last.c (print_record): use HOST_LEN if available.

	* dev_hash.c: change data structure so that there isn't a limit on
 	the length of a device name in memory.
	* uid_hash.c: same as above, but change made for username.

	* last.c: change the #define business to real enums for error
 	checking.
	* sa.c: same.

Fri Jan 26 00:21:56 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle.psych.oberlin.edu>

	* sa.c (parse_acct_entries): fix printed length of command names
 	(so we don't print extra junk on the end of the output lines).

	* Removed RCSIDs from source files and installed a new versioning
 	scheme.
	* version.h: file that contains the release number information.

	* Makefile.in (lastcomm-test, sa-test): add some `-' prefixes for
 	bad return values of the `time' program on some systems
 	(m68k-bsd-sony).

Thu Jan 25 04:18:07 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@csxt.cs.oberlin.edu>

	* utmp_rd.c (utmp_get_entry): fix FSEEK command's distance -- was
	zero for the first call!
	* pacct_rd.c (pacct_get_entry): same.

Thu Jan 25 01:01:40 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle.psych.oberlin.edu>

	* ac.c, last.c, lastcomm.c, sa.c: print fatal errors to stdout
 	instead of stderr.

Wed Jan 24 03:41:36 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle.psych.oberlin.edu>

	* last.c (main): make sure PRINT_ALL_RECORDS gets set if the user
 	is trying to print out a particular user/tty.

	* ac.c (main): add `--compatibility' flag which makes the program
 	behave like most other u*x ACs.
	* accounting.texi (ac): update documentation.
	* ac.1: same.

	* Makefile.in (SA_OBJS): added pacct_rd.o.

	* pacct_rd.h: renamed NEVER_USED variable so it wouldn't conflict
 	with the other definition in utmp_rd.h.
	* utmp_rd.h: similar...

	* configure.in: detect presence and types of fields in STRUCT
 	ACCT.
	* acconfig.h: added #defines for above mods.
	* makecnst: removed file, since autoconf does it all nowadays.

	* last.c (give_usage): fix usage string to reflect old-style
 	option processing.
	* last.1: same.
	* accounting.texi (last): same.

Wed Jan 24 06:25:14 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@wombat.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* utmp_rd.c (utmp_get_entry): the ibm-rt lets us fseek to a
        negative location?!  Grr.  Fix the check to see whether we're done
        with a file...
	* pacct_rd.c (pacct_get_entry): same.

Wed Jan 24 02:35:47 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle.psych.oberlin.edu>

	* utmp_rd.c (utmp_get_entry): skip invalid records (those without
 	a tty or valid time) and retry.

Tue Jan 23 02:11:37 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle.psych.oberlin.edu>

	* Fixed all sources to pay attention to HAVE_STRING_H,
 	HAVE_STDLIB_H, HAVE_UNISTD_H, and HAVE_LIMITS_H.
	
	* configure.in (HAVE_MKTIME): change definitions so that Makefile
 	is modified, rather than having mktime.c be #included from ac.c.
	* Makefile.in: same.
	
	* pacct_rd.c (pacct_get_entry): fix buglet where we would loop
 	infinitely if we couldn't open a file (forgot to remove that file
 	from the list).
	* utmp_rd.c (utmp_get_entry): same.
	
	* dev_hash.c (setup_devices): fix buglet where we tried to look
 	through entries in non-existent directories.

	* pacct_rd.c (comp_t_2_double): moved this from common.c, since it
 	isn't used by all programs.

	* dev_hash.c, dev_hash.h: new files which take care of device
 	number to name resolution.
	(setup_devices): change calling convention -- takes an argument
 	which is the name of a directory from which elements should be
 	added.

	* last.c (print_record): field width taken care of at compile
 	time.

	* pacct_rd.c, pacct_rd.h: new files which read from pacct/acct
 	files.
	* lastcomm.c: modified to use pacct_rd.c.
	* Makefile.in (lastcomm): added dependencies for pacct_rd.c.

	* configure.in: add a check for the COMP_T being used in
 	<sys/acct.h>.

	* utmp_rd.h (NAME_LEN, TTY_LEN): moved this stuff from common.h.

	* Makefile.in (OBJS): added utmp_rd.o.
	(depend): regenerated dependencies.

	* lastcomm.c (HASH): added this #define since it was taken out of
 	uid_hash.h.

	* common.h (NAME_LEN, TTY_LEN): instead of #defining constants,
 	make the compiler do the work -- use sizeof.

	* uid_hash.h: removed stuff that other source files didn't need to
 	see (struct definitions, internal tables, etc.) to uid_hash.c.

	* uid_hash.h (uid_list): fix smally typo in variable type (missing
 	the `*').

	* last.c (parse_entries): fix the initialization of the LAST_TIME
 	variable.

	* uid_hash.h: removed silly #ifdef for an extern (was inserted to
 	get around an old gcc 1.39 warning message) -- not really useful
 	anymore.

	* utmp_rd.h: move #defines for RECORD_TYPE & c. here so AC and
 	LAST can share the same code.

	* acconfig.h: rename HAVE_ACCT_H to HAVE_SYS_ACCT_H.

	* utmp_rd.c, utmp_rd.h: new files which manage reading from
 	multiple wtmp files.
	* ac.c (main): make it use code from utmp_rd.c.
	* last.c (main): same.
	* Makefile.in (ac last): add utmp_rd.c to object file lists.

	* last.c (main): Add code to handle old-style (like `-10')
 	options.

	* REMEMBER TO DOCUMENT CHANGES AS THEY HAPPEN...

Fri Jan 19 09:45:01 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle.psych.oberlin.edu>

	* common.h: add #defines for NAME_LEN.
	* ac.c: change structure definitions and other code to use NAME
 	len instead of having '8' hard-coded all over the place.
	* last.c: same.

	* ac.c (init_flags_and_data): remove this stuff, since most
 	compilers can handle variable initialization!
	* last.c (init_flags_and_data): same.
	
Fri Jan  5 18:34:52 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle.vo.com>

	* Makefile.in, acconfig.h, configure.in: update to new version of
 	autoconf.  Changed a few affected files because of renamed
 	preprocessor variables (common.c, common.h, lastcomm.c).

	* Makefile.in: fixed a few "bogus" lines (according to emacs
 	19.30).

	* accounting.texi: fixed numerous bugs pointed out by Susan.

	* ac.1, accton.1, last.1, lastcomm.1, sa.1: added excellent man
 	pages from Susan Kleinmann <sgk@sgk.tiac.net> to the repository.

Mon Dec 18 10:07:14 1995  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle.vo.com>

	* sa.c (main): fix command-line flag combination check (use AND
 	instead of OR).

	* makecnst (flag): try to find cpp.  Really this should be
 	autoconfiscated.  I'll do that later today.

	*** The following changes were done before 18 Dec 1995 by Dirk and
 	others, but they weren't documented heretofore. ***

	* files.h: change #defines to reflect Linux's new filesystem
 	standard.

	* accton.c (main): return correct exit status for each execution
 	possibility.

	* accounting.texi: fix a few formatting glitches, change
 	documentation relating to change of "--truncate-ftp-entries" flag.

	* Makefile.in (last-test): remove "--truncate-ftp-entries" since
 	it is now the default behaviour.

	* last.c: change the "--truncate-ftp-entries" flag to
 	"--no-truncate-ftp-entries" and make truncation (is that a word?)
 	the default.

Fri Oct 13 09:41:36 1995  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@miles.econ.queensu.ca>

	* uid_hash.h (NAME_LEN): fixed bug#1651 reported and patched by 
	  Austin Donnelly <and1000@cam.ac.uk>

Mon Oct  2 16:39:00 1995  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@miles.econ.queensu.ca>

	* accton.c: exit() now returns value of `errno' and /etc/init.d/acct
	  examines that value; this gives better messages
	  
	* accounting.texi: added a missing formatter for @item 

	* last.1 man page addded

Pre Sep 21 00:00:00 1995  Ian Murdock  <imurdock@debian.org>

        * added __linux__ definitions to files.h (we use
 	/var/account/pacct as ACCT_FILE, /var/account/wtmp as WTMP_FILE,
 	/var/account/savacct as SAVACCT_FILE, and /var/account/usracct as
 	USRACCT_FILE)
	
        * changed last to truncate ftp entries by default (as Unix does
 	it)
	
        * fixed a typo in accounting.texi
