New in 6.3.2:

  * Small memory leak fixed in sa.

  * Released to the general public.


New in 6.3.1:

  * A `NEWS' file (and others) so that we conform to the GNU
    requirements for packaging.

  * We use `automake' to build the package, so things like ansi2knr
    should be called automatically for those of you that don't have
    ANSI C compilers.  It also helps write the install targets, etc.
    Very cool.  I was suprised how easy it was to integrate into this
    package.  Hats off to David J. MacKenzie and Tom Tromey!


New in 6.3:

  * Hey!  We're on prep.ai.mit.edu!

  * Renamed long option `--year' to `--print-year' in both the ac and
  last programs.

  * Added a `--print-seconds' (or `-s') flag to last, for those who
  really want the nitty-gritty.

  * Added a `--sort-real-time' option to sa for those who want to sort
  the output by "real" (elapsed) time.

  * Fixed a buffer overrun error in sa which was preventing it from
  sorting the username list correctly.
