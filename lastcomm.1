.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B lastcomm
prints out information about previously executed
commands.  If no arguments are specified, 
.B lastcomm 
will print info
about all of the commands in 
.I acct
(the record file).  If called with one or more of
.I command-name,
.I user-name, 
or 
.I terminal-name,
only records containing those items will be displayed.  For 
example, to find out which users used command `a.out' 
and which users were logged into `tty0', type:
.ce
lastcomm a.out tty0
.ce 0
.LP
This will print any entry for which `a.out' or `tty0' 
matches in any of the record's fields (command, name, or terminal).  If 
you want to find only items that match *all* of the arguments on the command 
line, you must use the '\-strict-match' option.  For example, to list 
all of the executions of command 
.IR a.out " by user " root " on terminal " tty0, 
type:
.ce 
lastcomm \-\-strict-match a.out root tty0
.ce 0
.LP
The order of the arguments is not important.
.LP
For each entry the following information is printed:
   + command name of the process
   + flags, as recorded by the system accounting routines:
        S -- command executed by super-user
        F -- command executed after a fork but without a following exec
        C -- command run in PDP-11 compatibility mode (VAX only)
        D -- command terminated with the generation of a core file
        X -- command was terminated with the signal SIGTERM
   + the name of the user who ran the process
   + time the process exited
